# Why it is functional

## It supports below instructions:

    U                   set pen up
    D                   set pen down
    G  x y              goto x y    (position)
    N  distance         draw line toward North (up)
    S  distance         draw line toward  South (down)
    E  distance         draw line toward  East (left)
    W  distance         draw line toward  West (right)
    X  distance         draw line along x axis 
    Y  distance         draw line down y axis 
    L  degree distance  draw line certain with distance at certain degree

## It has a powerful shell (interpreter)

You can use all short format instructions in the shell.

You can also use below long format instructionsï¼š

    penup                   set pen up
    pendown                 set pen down
    pencolor                set pen color
    pensize                 set pen size
    select_pen              select pen
    goto                    goto position
    get_along               go along x axis
    go_down                 go along y axis
    forward                 go along original direction
    draw_line               draw line with 
    reset                   clear all the drawing
    record                  record instructions to file
    playback                playback from instructions file
    bye                     good bye
    

## It supports two drawing engine:

- tkinter
- turtle

## It supports two type of configuration file

- ini file
- yaml file 

## It can run in multiple ways 

It can run as an interpreter, a batch instructions processor, and a command line application supports 
below arguments and options:

    Tigr.
    
    Usage:
      tigr.py [FILES ...] [-c c.ini] [-e tkinter] [-s 5] [-p regex] [--pencolor black] [--pensize 1] [-i]
    
    You can also run all the unittest by this command: python -m unittest discover tigr/test
    You can also run all the doc-test by this command: python -m doctest -v tigr/drawer/tkinter_worker.py
    
    Options:
      -h --help                  Show this screen.
      -c 1.ini --config 1.ini    Specify the ini config file name
      -e turtle --engine turtle  Specify the drawer engine, tkinter or turtle. [default: turtle]
      -s 5 --speed 5             Specify the drawer speed, 1 slowest, 9 fastest [default: 5]
      -p regex --parser regex    Specify the instruction parser [default: peg]
      --pencolor black           Specify pen color [default: black]
      --pensize 1                Specify pen size [default: 1]
      -i --interactive           Specify if enter interactive mode when the script files were executed done [default: 0]
      --version                  Show version
    
    Attention:
    
    If an option is found in config file and command line arguments at the same time,
    this program will use the value from the ini file.

## Typical use scenario

### As an interpreter

    python tigr.py 
    
### As a batch processor
    
    python tigr.py < tigr/test/test-instructions.txt
    
### As a command line application

   python tigr.py -c config.ini -e tkinter --pencolor red --pensize 2 --speed 9 tigr/test/instructions{2,1}.txt
